This project is connected to the GitHub repository at:
https://github.com/omis-2025/strangerwave.git

## Pushing Code to GitHub

To push your code changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Add all the files you want to commit:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
   
   Or specific files:
   ```
   git add file1.js file2.js
   ```

2. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

3. Push your changes to the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Authentication

You'll need to authenticate to GitHub when pushing. If you're prompted for credentials, you can:

- Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) as the password
- Set up SSH keys for authentication

## GitHub Actions

This project has a GitHub Actions workflow configured at `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` that will automatically build the AAB file when triggered.

To manually trigger this workflow after pushing:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Select the "Android Build" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" button

The resulting AAB file will be available as an artifact when the workflow completes.

If you need to download the deployment package directly:
1. Go to: https://workspacestep4.danielufkgigg.repl.co/ (This URL should be replaced with your actual Replit URL)
2. The download will start automatically

## Build Instructions

After downloading the deployment package:
1. Extract the archive: `tar -xzf strangerwave-deployment-package.tar.gz`
