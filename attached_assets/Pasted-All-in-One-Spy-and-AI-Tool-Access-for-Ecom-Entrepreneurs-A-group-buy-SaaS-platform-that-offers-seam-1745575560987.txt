Asking price reasoning
Our asking price reflects a 3.3x multiple on net annual profit, aligned with current SaaS market valuations. While this has a 28% monthly churn, common in group-buy or short-term utility models, the business compensates with strong organic acquisition and minimal operational cost. The product is fully automated, requires zero support, and serves a niche with constant demand from new ecom founders. High gross margin + predictable cash flow = strong ROI opportunity.
