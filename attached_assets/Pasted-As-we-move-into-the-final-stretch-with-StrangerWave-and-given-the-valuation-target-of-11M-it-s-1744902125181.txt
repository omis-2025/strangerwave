As we move into the final stretch with StrangerWave â€” and given the valuation target of $11M+ â€” it's critical that we ensure the platform is production-ready, bug-free, and visually flawless before launching or handing it off to any acquirers.

I'd like to request a comprehensive QA pass on the full application â€” both frontend and backend â€” to validate that every element functions correctly and meets a high design and usability standard.

Please review and test the following areas thoroughly:

ðŸ”¹ Landing Page & Visual Elements
Verify payment method logos (Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Apple Pay, etc.) are visible and styled consistently

Ensure the "What Our Users Say" section includes profile pictures for each testimonial

All calls to action (CTAs) and plan-selection buttons must be working properly

ðŸ”¹ Payment & Checkout Flows
Confirm Stripe and PayPal checkouts function properly for:

VIP and Premium subscriptions

Unban payments

Check responsiveness, layout alignment, and button interactivity across all plans

Validate pricing visibility per region

ðŸ”¹ Core App Functionality
Video/text chat working flawlessly across all browsers and devices

Matching engine accuracy (filters by gender & country)

Moderation tools (bans, reports, and unban automation after payment)

Token system functionality (if active)

ðŸ”¹ Cross-Platform & Browser Compatibility
Full testing on Chrome, Safari, Firefox

Mobile (iOS & Android) and desktop experience consistency

Responsive layout for all breakpoints

Deliverables:
A quick QA summary report outlining:

Any critical bugs found (with screenshots or video if needed)

Any layout issues or inconsistencies

Confirmation of successful tests on payments and chat features

This is a key step to ensure the platform truly reflects its $11M+ valuation and can confidently be presented to advisors or buyers. Please prioritize this task and let me know once it's complete â€” happy to review it together afterward if needed.

Thanks again for the hard work
