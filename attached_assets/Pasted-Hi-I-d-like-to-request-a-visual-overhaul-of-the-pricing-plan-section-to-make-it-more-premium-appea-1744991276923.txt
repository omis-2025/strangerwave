Hi! I'd like to request a visual overhaul of the pricing plan section to make it more premium, appealing, and easier to read. Right now, it looks a bit plain and could benefit from more polish. Please implement the following improvements:

🎨 Visual Design Recommendations:
✅ Add visual hierarchy:

Make the plan titles (“Free”, “Premium”, “VIP”) larger and bolder for immediate clarity.

Highlight the most popular or best value plan with a badge or ribbon (“Most Popular”, “Best Value”).

✅ Improve card styling:

Add soft shadows, rounded corners, and slight hover animations to each plan card.

Use subtle gradients or glassmorphism to give the VIP plan a premium feel.

Adjust spacing/padding inside each card for better readability.

✅ Fix font contrast and clarity:

Use consistent font sizes, colors, and spacing.

Make feature text slightly larger and improve spacing between bullet points.

✅ Improve CTA buttons:

Use bright, gradient buttons for “Start Free Trial” and “Subscribe Now”.

Add hover/press effects (scale up, glowing border, etc.) for interactivity.

✅ Make discount + promo offer pop:

Move the “30% off” promo banner closer to the VIP plan or make it more visually connected.

Highlight the WAVE30 code with a small clipboard icon to copy it instantly.

✅ Make the toggle (Monthly/Yearly) more attractive:

Style the toggle switch with animated transitions and modern look.

Indicate yearly savings more clearly and attractively (e.g., “Save 16% — Best Value!”)

💡 Optional Ideas to Consider:
Add a comparison checkmark grid below showing which features are in which plan.

Animate the pricing cards on load for a smoother experience (fade/slide in).

Add testimonials or small trust signals (like ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “Loved by 10,000+ users”)

Make it mobile-responsive and tested across screen sizes for perfect layout on phones and tablets.

Please redesign the pricing section following these recommendations to better match a modern SaaS-style premium landing page. Let me know when the changes are ready so I can review and test them across devices. Thanks!
