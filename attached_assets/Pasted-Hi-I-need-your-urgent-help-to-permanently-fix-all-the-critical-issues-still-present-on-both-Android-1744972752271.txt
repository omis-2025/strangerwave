Hi, I need your urgent help to permanently fix all the critical issues still present on both Android and iOS devices after repeated testing. Despite multiple revisions, many problems persist — and they need to be resolved once and for all. Please read this carefully and ensure everything is addressed properly.

🔧 High Priority Mobile Issues:
1. UI Alignment & Layout Issues:

The app is not centered properly on Android and iOS. The layout appears shifted, cutting off header text and elements, especially on iPhones.

The design should be centered, responsive, and fit the full screen of any device without overflowing or shrinking.

No visual should be “split” or misaligned — all components must auto-adjust based on screen size.

2. Chat Connection & Video Bug:

After matching, the video camera disappears and only a broken full-screen text panel remains.

Text messaging doesn’t work — input isn’t responsive or visible.

Video must stay active after match, with camera views and text chat working in parallel.

3. Missing & Broken Buttons:

"Stop" and "Next" buttons are missing on mobile after a match is made.

When the chat ends, there is no clear way to return or re-enter queue.

Clicking on the screen randomly shows "Next", but clicking it resets the entire process instead of just moving to the next match. This is incorrect behavior.

4. Initial Matching Screen Design:

When starting the match process, the UI is completely broken — layout is chaotic with overlapping or misaligned elements.

This screen must be polished: clean design, centered content, smooth animation while searching.

5. Filter Panel Bugs:

The country selection is missing from the filter panel — this is a critical feature.

Replace “genderqueer” and “genderfluid” options with “Choose Country” filter instead.

Filters must be functional and visually clean.

🛠️ What You Need to Do:
✅ Fix full-screen layout issues for all screen sizes (Android & iOS)
✅ Ensure camera + video + text chat all work together after match
✅ Always show Stop (red) and Next buttons consistently
✅ Make Next button only skip to next match — it should NOT reset chat flow
✅ Fix initial match screen UI — remove clutter, polish layout
✅ Add working country filter — let users choose which country they want to match with
✅ Remove unnecessary genders: replace with country-only match filter
✅ Do full test on real Android & iOS devices after these fixes

🚨 Final Notes:
This is the 10th+ time I’ve reported these same bugs. Each time I’m told it’s fixed, but after testing, I find the same problems again. This is affecting launch readiness, UX, and trust in the build process.

Please take this seriously and ensure all these fixes are implemented, tested on real mobile devices, and confirmed working properly.
I want the app to look and function like a polished, premium mobile experience — no more patchy or half-finished fixes.

Let me know once these are resolved, and if you need me to record a screen video to clarify anything, I’m happy to do that.

Thanks!
