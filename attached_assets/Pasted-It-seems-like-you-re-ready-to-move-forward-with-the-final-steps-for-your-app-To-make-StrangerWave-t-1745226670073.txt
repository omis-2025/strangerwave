      <h2>Invite Your Friends!</h2>
      <button onClick={handleReferral}>Send Referral Link</button>

  );
};
Feedback Form Component
const FeedbackForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("Thank you for your feedback!");
    // Logic to submit feedback to server goes here
  };
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <textarea required placeholder="Your feedback..."></textarea>
      <button type="submit">Submit Feedback</button>
    </form>
  );
};
Server Configuration
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 5000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}`);
});
