Thank you again for the comprehensive and insightful responses! The level of detail you've provided is incredibly helpful, and it's clearing up many questions I had about implementation. I'm particularly excited about integrating MediaSoup and refining the matching algorithm for scalability.

Here's my follow-up:

1. WebRTC with MediaSoup: I really appreciate the hybrid architecture suggestion. I'm planning to start with 1-2 MediaSoup workers and scale from there. For the Redis message broker, I assume it will be used to coordinate the load across the workers, ensuring each is handling an optimal number of users. Do you have any further recommendations on handling the communication between the signaling server on Replit and the MediaSoup workers efficiently, especially as traffic grows?

2. TURN/STUN Service: Twilio's TURN service sounds perfect for the Twilio's TURN service sounds perfect for the initial stage. The cost estimate is very helpful as well. I plan to start with Twilio and monitor the usage as we grow. Once we approach the 50K user mark, I'll evaluate transitioning to Coturn. Would it be advisable to keep using Twilio for backup after transitioning to a self-hosted TURN service, or should we fully migrate?

3. User Matching Algorithm: The match score algorithm looks solid ! I'll be testing this soon . For the The match scoring algorithm looks solid! I'll be testing this soon. For the "interest match" component, I'm curious if there are ways to optimize it further as user activity grows (eg, precomputing some data or using an in-memory store). Do you have any suggestions for improving performance as we scale?

4. Subscription Management: Your approach to failed payments and renewal notifications makes a lot of sense . I'll Your approach to failed payments and renewal notifications makes a lot of sense. I'll implement the webhook for failed payments and the notification strategy as outlined. One thing I wanted to checkâ€”how would you recommend handling multiple subscription plans, especially if users switch between tiers or decide to upgrade/downgrade? Would this require significant changes in the subscription lifecycle management?

5. Geographic Distribution & Database Partitioning: The regional partitioning strategy for The regional partitioning strategy for the database is really helpful. I plan to start with the US East region and expand from there. Do you have any suggestions on optimizing the query routing system as we expand to multiple regions, particularly when a region is experiencing high load?

I'm excited to dive deeper into these implementations and get started with building out the infrastructure. Your expertise is invaluable as I navigate these next steps.

Thanks again for all the support, and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
