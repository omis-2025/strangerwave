Thank you for the additional recommendations! They are incredibly helpful in ensuring the app is ready for submission and launch. Here's how I'll proceed based on your suggestions:

1. Pre-Submission Technical Checks

Final Build Testing: I will test the AAB and IPA builds on both high-end and lower-end devices, ensuring the app performs well across device types. I'll also test for network connectivity issues, including app behavior when the connection is lost.

Deep State Testing: I’ll run tests for extended use (1+ hour sessions), check memory usage, and verify account recovery and password reset flows. I’ll also test scenarios where the app is forcibly closed during a chat.

Final Security Audit: I will run a final check for any hardcoded credentials, ensure all API endpoints use HTTPS, and verify data encryption during transit and storage.

2. Store-Specific Final Preparations

Google Play:

App Signing: I’ll back up my keystore in multiple secure locations and document the password securely.

Staged Rollout: I’ll start the rollout with a small percentage (10-20%) of users and increase gradually based on app performance.

Store Listing Optimization: I’ll double-check all screenshots, feature graphics, and content to make sure they align with the target market and comply with all regulations.

Apple App Store:

Build Version Strategy: I’ll increment the build number for all future submissions, including rejected ones.

Export Compliance: I’ll prepare the necessary information regarding app encryption (HTTPS) and be ready to submit any additional documentation if required.

App Review Optimization: I’ll ensure clear test instructions are provided and include a demo account for the reviewer. I might also add a short demo video showcasing complex features.

3. Launch Marketing Preparations

I’ll prepare announcement materials like a press release, social media posts, and an email to our mailing list.

I’ll create a FAQ document for customer support and set up channels (email, in-app, etc.).

I’ll set up analytics dashboards to track key metrics like crashes, conversions, and retention.

4. Final Documentation Updates

Internal Documentation: I’ll ensure all technical documentation is updated, including keystore/certificate information and emergency procedures.

External Documentation: I’ll finalize user guides and tutorial content and update the website with app store links (to go live post-approval).

Compliance Documentation: I’ll document all compliance measures, including testing for age verification, IAP implementation, and GDPR/CCPA compliance.

5. Post-Launch Quick Response Plan

I’ll define critical issue response criteria and prepare communication templates for any issues that arise.

I’ll set up a schedule for daily review meetings during the first week, with a clear plan for emergency hotfixes and a rotation for on-call support.

With all of these tasks in mind, I feel confident that we’re on track for a smooth submission and successful launch. If there's any additional information you think I need to address or if you'd like to elaborate further on any area, please let me know.

Thanks again for your continued support!
