Thanks again for all the great progress so far — the StrangerWave landing page is looking solid.

After reviewing the current layout and flow, I’ve put together a few enhancement suggestions aimed at boosting clarity, trust, and conversions. Some are quick wins, others are optional but worth considering as we move toward polishing the MVP.

🔧 Suggestions to Improve Landing Page:

Hero Subheadline or Immediate Benefit

Add a short subheadline like:
“Meet new people through fast, anonymous chats — no sign-up required.”

Purpose: Instantly conveys value and reduces friction.

Highlight the Start Chatting Button

Add pulsing animation or a chat icon (👋 or 💬)

Improve hover effect to feel more interactive/tactile

Social Proof Section (Optional)

Display user rating (e.g., 4.7/5 ⭐)

Add 1–2 short quotes/testimonials

Highlight reach: “Used in 50+ countries” (with globe icon or flags)

Clarify Pricing Value

Add small line by the pricing area: “Premium from just $2.99/month — cancel anytime.”

Mobile Optimization

Double-check mobile spacing, touch targets, button sizing

Ensure fast load speed, especially for hero and image-heavy areas

🎬 Optional Features

Add a short animation or video demo of the app in action

Include a simple FAQ dropdown below the fold

Exit-intent popup (for visitors leaving):
“Still deciding? Try StrangerWave free — no card required.”

📋 Notion / Git Task List

Hero Section

 Add hero subheadline with user benefit

 Style subheadline (smaller than main heading but eye-catching)

CTA Buttons

Social Proof Section

Pricing Clarity

 Add microcopy near pricing: “From $2.99/mo — cancel anytime”

Mobile Checks

 Check button sizing and layout responsiveness

 Test load time and optimize assets if needed

Optional (Stretch)

 Add 15–30 sec explainer animation or video

 Add FAQ section (expand/collapse)

 Design & implement exit popup (optional offer or CTA)

Let me know which of these you'd like to prioritize, or if you'd like me to help source testimonials, flag icons, or write the FAQ entries.
