Thanks again for your work — but after fully testing the app on both Android and iOS devices , I've found multiple critical issues that must be fixed permanently . Some of these problems have been raised over 10 times before. Please go through every point below and confirm that they are all resolved — this is urgent and final before launch.

🚨Major Mobile Issues (iOS + Android)
Text Cut Off / Alignment Issues

Headings and text are missing characters on the left in multiple screens.
→ Ensure all text and headings are fully visible and properly aligned on all screens.

Screen Fit / Centering Bug

The app layout is not centered or scaling properly. Content shifts left/right and doesn't fit full phone width.
→ The entire app must scale and center correctly on all devices , both portrait and landscape.

Camera Disappears After Match

Once users connect to a match, the camera feed disappears and shows only a non-functional text box.
→ This must show video feed + working chat + visible Stop/Next buttons right after matching.

Broken Chat System

The messaging doesn't work — messages are not sent or received between users.

Remove any “demo text” or test content.
→ Chat should be live and working reliably between matched users.

Stop/Next Buttons Missing or Broken

Stop and Next buttons are missing on mobile or appear only after tapping the screen randomly.

Clicking “Next” or tapping screen often resets the whole app instead of skipping .
→ Buttons must always be visible .
→ "Next" must skip to the next user only , NOT return to the beginning.

🎯 Filter Section Fixes
Remove Unwanted Gender Options

❌ Genderqueer

❌ Genderfluid

❌ Non-binary

❌ Other

Replace with Country Selector
→ Add a clean “ Choose Country ” dropdown in the filter section after clicking Start Chat .

💳 Pricing Page Fixes
Landing Page Bug

The landing page disappears after 1 second — this must be fixed immediately.

Correct Pricing Plans:

Premium: $4.99/month

VIP: $7.99/month

Design Improvements (See Visual)

Make pricing section more modern and attractive

Improve layout spacing, highlight features, add smooth hover animations

Add badges like “Best Value” or “Most Affordable”
→ I've attached a mockup image showing how the section should look visually — please follow that style .

🧠 AI Moderation (Important for User Safety)
To ensure compliance with Terms of Use and create a safer community, please add the following system:

✅ AI or keyword detector to monitor chat and video sessions

❌ Automatically ban or mute users who:

Use vulgar/inappropriate words (eg, “fuck”, “sex”, racial slurs, etc.)

Show nudity, underwear, or sexual content on video

✅ Add detection logic and warning/muting system

✅ Allow us to manually update blocklist with new words/phrases

This is crucial to avoid misuse and protect the platform legally and reputationally.

✅ Summary of Final Fixes Needed

Ensure app fits screen and centers properly

🚨 Please confirm all of these are fixed and fully tested before marking anything complete . I need everything working 100% across all mobile devices — this is no longer acceptable to repeat fixes over and over.

Let me know when done. Thank you.
