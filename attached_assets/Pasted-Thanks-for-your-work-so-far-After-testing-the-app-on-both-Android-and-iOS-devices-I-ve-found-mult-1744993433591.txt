Thanks for your work so far. After testing the app on both Android and iOS devices , I've found multiple critical issues that must be fixed permanently . Some of these problems have been raised before — please go through this carefully and make sure everything is resolved properly this time.

🚨Major Issues (Mobile Devices)
Text Cut Off on Mobile

Headings and text are getting cut off on the left side on both Android and iOS.
→ All text should be fully visible and aligned across devices.

App Not Centered / Screen Fit Issues

The layout is not centered or scaling properly. It shifts left/right and doesn't fully fit the screen.
→ The app must scale and center properly on all phones — full responsive layout with no visual shift.

Video Chat Connection Bug

After matching, the camera disappears and the screen shows only a text chat view that doesn't work.
→ The user should see the video feed + working chat + visible controls after match connects.

Missing or Broken Chat Controls

Stop and Next buttons are missing or hidden.

After ending a session, there's no visible way to return — tapping the screen sometimes shows “Next,” but pressing it restarts the entire session instead of skipping.
→ Fix this: “Next” should only skip to a new user , not reset the app.

Chat System Not Working

Messages typed are not being received by the matched user.
→ There should be no “demo mode” — the chat must send/receive messages live and reliably between both users.

🛠️ Filter Section Fixes
After "Let's Start Chat" — Remove These Genders:

❌ Genderqueer

❌ Genderfluid

❌ Non-binary

❌ Other

Add “Choose Country” Instead

Replace the extra gender options with a country selector dropdown , so users can match by country.

🎨 Pricing Plan Issues
Landing Page Bug

The landing page loads and disappears after 1 second — this must be fixed so users can see it and interact.

Fix the Pricing Amounts:

Premium Plan: $4.99/month

VIP Plan: $7.99/month
→ Update these in both monthly and yearly views accordingly.

Improve Visual Design

The pricing section needs to look more professional and premium:

Better spacing between plans

Modern icons and color styles

Clearer plan labels (eg, “Most Affordable”, “Best Value”)

Smoother buttons and layout

📌 I've attached a visual mockup to follow for styling — please use it to polish this section.
