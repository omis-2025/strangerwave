The provided GitHub Actions workflow configuration looks good for building an Android project but here are some points to ensure you are set up correctly:

Java Version: You're using JDK 17, which is fine, but make sure it aligns with the requirements of your Android project. The android/build.gradle file mentions using the compile SDK version but doesnâ€™t specify the Java version requirement. If the project relies on features from JDK 11 or another version, reflect that.

Gradle Execution: You're correctly setting execute permissions for gradlew. Make sure the android/gradlew file exists and is properly configured with the necessary gradle settings for your project.

Debug Build: This workflow only builds a debug variant of the APK. If you're aiming for a release variant, you'll need to add another step specifically for that:

- name: Build Release APK
  run: cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
And similarly upload the release artifact if necessary.

Artifact Upload: Make sure that the output paths for the APK files match exactly with where Gradle is outputting them. According to your configuration, it should be verified against the Android build outputs.

Your workflow can be summarized like this:

name: Android Build
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: gradle
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Build web app
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Copy web assets to Android
        run: npx cap copy android
      
      - name: Sync Android project
        run: npx cap sync android
      
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x android/gradlew
      
      - name: Build Debug APK
        run: cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
      
      - name: Build Release APK
        run: cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
      - name: Upload Debug APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: app-debug
          path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
      - name: Upload Release APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: app-release
          path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
Make sure to test this configuration and adjust as per your specific project requirements. If you run into any issues during the build process, let me know!
