This is the FINAL and FULL list of what must be fixed and delivered 100% — no shortcuts, no excuses.

I’ve invested too much time and money into this project, and I’m tired of ongoing bugs and half-working features. This app must be fully optimized, protected, stable, and ready to scale — or it's not worth continuing. Please read this carefully and take it seriously.

🔧 CORE FUNCTIONALITY FIXES
Landing Page Bug

Fix issue where landing page disappears after 1 second — it must stay visible until the user acts.

Match/Next Bug

“Next” button sometimes restarts the whole app instead of skipping to the next person.

This MUST be fixed. “Next” = move to a new match, never restart.

Text + Video Chat System

Video disappears after match; text and video must work together in real-time like Omegle.

Text messages must send and be received immediately — not fake “demo” messages.

“Stop” and “Next” Buttons

These buttons are missing on mobile. They must be visible and functional on all devices.

Camera Flip

Add camera switch option (front/back) during video chat for mobile.

Identify Gender & Country

Clearly show the matched user’s gender and country in a modern UI format.

🧭 FILTERS SYSTEM FIX
Fix Gender Filters

REMOVE: Genderqueer, Genderfluid, Non-binary, Other.

Keep only: Male, Female

Add Country Filter

Add dropdown to let users choose the country they want to match with.

🛡️ SAFETY SYSTEM (PROTECTION FROM BAD USERS)
AI / Toxic Language Filter

Auto-detect and ban users who use:

Vulgar/explicit words like “fuck,” “sex,” “horny,” etc.

Show nudity, underwear, or violate rules

✅ Bonus: Add flag/report feature so users can help moderate.

Auto-Ban & Ban Log System

Offenders should be auto-banned and logged, with reason + timestamp.

💰 PRICING SYSTEM
Pricing Fix & Modern Look

Premium = $4.99/month

VIP = $7.99/month (add yearly discount: 16%)

Redesign this section with:

Modern layout

Icons, checkmarks for benefits

Animations on hover

Benefits like “No ads,” “Priority Match,” “Exclusive Filters,” etc.

Fix Stripe Payment Logic

Buttons must link to correct Stripe product IDs and handle errors properly.

Auto-unban users after payment.

📱 UI/UX & DESIGN FIXES
Responsive Layout

App MUST work on all screen sizes (iOS, Android, tablets, laptops).

No text should be cut off, layout broken, or elements outside the screen.

Fix Alignment

Fully center all app content. No misaligned boxes or buttons.

Modern UI Look

Remove old split-screen layout.

Use dark mode, soft gradients, animated transitions.

Clean, simple, TikTok-level UI polish.

Video Size Fix

Video should take 50/50 of screen or auto-resize responsively.

🔒 STABILITY, PERFORMANCE, & OPTIMIZATION
Fix Random Crashes

App must NOT crash on tap, next, or video connect.

Optimize Memory + Data Usage

Ensure no memory leaks, excessive RAM usage, or video lag.

Fast Loading Time

App should load in <2s, even on slow networks.

Reduce Server Errors (500s/404s)

No missing endpoints, broken routing, or console errors.

Security Best Practices

Prevent code injection, script abuse, or token leaks.

Use input sanitization and rate limits where needed.

Persistent Settings

Save user language, filters, and login session — even after refresh.

🔎 TEST BEFORE DELIVERY
✅ You must test:

On Android + iOS

On slow network (3G/4G)

With 50+ users active

Across all filters, chat types, pricing logic

In both languages (English + other translations if any)

🚨 Final Notes
I’m trusting you to fix this once and for all. If these issues can’t be fixed properly, I need to know so I can stop wasting time and money.

This is your final checklist. Once everything here is 100% done and stable, we’ll move forward.

Let’s finish this the right way.
