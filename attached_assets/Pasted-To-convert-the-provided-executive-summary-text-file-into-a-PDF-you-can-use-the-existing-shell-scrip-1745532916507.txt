To convert the provided executive summary text file into a PDF, you can use the existing shell script generate-pitch-deck.sh in your project. This script converts Markdown files to PDFs using pandoc.

Here's how to do it:

Edit the Markdown Source: First, ensure that your executive summary text file is in Markdown format. It looks like you already have the content you need.

Create a Markdown File: If you haven't done so, convert the contents of the executive summary from the text file to a Markdown format and save it as docs/pitch-deck.md.

Run the Shell Script: Use the existing script in your project to generate the PDF. You can run the script from the terminal in your Replit environment:

bash generate-pitch-deck.sh
The script will then create a file named strangerwave-pitch-deck.pdf. Make sure that pandoc is installed in your Replit environment; if it's not, the script will prompt you to install it.

Existing Script
Hereâ€™s a concise overview of the generate-pitch-deck.sh for your reference:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Generating StrangerWave Pitch Deck PDF..."
# Check if pandoc is installed
if ! command -v pandoc &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: This script requires pandoc to be installed."
    echo "Please install pandoc with: apt-get install pandoc"
    exit 1
fi
# Ensure the pitch deck markdown exists
if [ ! -f "docs/pitch-deck.md" ]; then
    echo "Error: docs/pitch-deck.md not found!"
    exit 1
fi
# Create a temporary CSS file for styling
cat > temp-style.css << EOF
body {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    color: #333;
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
h1, h2, h3 {
    color: #3366cc;
}
h1 {
    font-size: 28px;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top: 40px;
}
h2 {
    font-size: 24px;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
    padding-bottom: 5px;
}
EOF
# Generate the PDF
echo "Converting Markdown to PDF..."
pandoc docs/pitch-deck.md -o strangerwave-pitch-deck.pdf --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf --css=temp-style.css
# Clean up
rm temp-style.css
# Check if conversion was successful
if [ -f "strangerwave-pitch-deck.pdf" ]; then
    echo "Success! PDF created: strangerwave-pitch-deck.pdf"
else
    echo "Error: PDF creation failed!"
    exit 1
fi
echo "Done."
Notes
Ensure your Markdown file (docs/pitch-deck.md) is formatted correctly for Pandoc.
After running the script, you can download the generated PDF from your project files in Replit.
