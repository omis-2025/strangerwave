Using these steps will ensure that you process a valid AAB file that can be uploaded to the Google Play Console. If you have any questions or run into issues during the local build process, feel free to ask!

It seems there is a misunderstanding regarding the Android App Bundle (AAB) files. To generate a valid AAB, you need to follow these exact steps using your local development environment, as the Replit environment cannot handle the build process for Android applications.

Here's a summary of the steps you need to take after you download the deployment package:

Download the Deployment Package:

Use the link: Download Deployment Package
Click the green "Download Deployment Package" button.
Save the 2.6MB file to your computer.
Extract the Package:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the package, then run:

tar -xzf strangerwave-deployment-package.tar.gz
Navigate to the Android Project:

cd export_package/android
Make Gradle Executable (for Mac/Linux only):

chmod +x gradlew
Build the AAB:
Run the build command:

On Mac/Linux:
./gradlew bundleRelease
On Windows:
gradlew.bat bundleRelease
Locate the AAB File:
After the build completes successfully, the AAB file will be located at:

app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
Using these steps will ensure that you process a valid AAB file that can be uploaded to the Google Play Console. If you have any questions or run into issues during the local build process, feel free to ask

just now
I notice you're trying to build the Android App Bundle (AAB) locally. However, we can build it directly in Replit using the existing build script. Let me help you generate the AAB:

cd android && chmod +x gradlew && ./gradlew bundleRelease
This command will:

Navigate to the android directory
Make gradlew executable
Build the release AAB
The AAB file will be generated at android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

The build process is already configured with the correct signing keys and build settings in the build.gradle and key.properties files. Once the build completes, you can verify the AAB file was created properly.

If you encounter any build issues, let me know and I can help troubleshoot them.
