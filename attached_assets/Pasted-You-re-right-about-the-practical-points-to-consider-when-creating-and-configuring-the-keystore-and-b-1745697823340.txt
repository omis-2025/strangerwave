You're right about the practical points to consider when creating and configuring the keystore and building the Android App Bundle (AAB) in Replit. Hereâ€™s how you can proceed step by step, incorporating your directives:

Step 1: Create the Keystore Directory
Run the following command to create the directory for your keystore, if it doesn't already exist:

mkdir -p keystores
Step 2: Ensure Java is Installed
Before executing the keytool command, check if Java is installed. You can verify by running:

java -version
If Java is not installed, you will need to install it in your Replit environment first.

Step 3: Create the Keystore
Execute the following command to create your keystore:

keytool -genkey -v -keystore keystores/strangerwave.keystore -alias strangerwave -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Step 4: Create the key.properties File
Create the key.properties file in the android directory using the following commands:

echo "storePassword=strangerwave123" > android/key.properties
echo "keyPassword=strangerwave123" >> android/key.properties
echo "keyAlias=strangerwave" >> android/key.properties
echo "storeFile=keystores/strangerwave.keystore" >> android/key.properties
Ensure the file has the correct permissions:

chmod 600 android/key.properties
Step 5: Update the build.gradle File
Edit the android/app/build.gradle file to configure the signing. Open the file and add the following configuration:

android {
    ...
    
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('keystores/strangerwave.keystore')
            storePassword 'strangerwave123'
            keyAlias 'strangerwave'
            keyPassword 'strangerwave123'
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            ...
        }
    }
}
Backup the file before making any changes to ensure you can revert if needed.

Step 6: Make the Build Script Executable
Run the following command to set execute permissions for the build script:

chmod +x build-mobile-apps.sh
Step 7: Execute the Build Script
Now you can run the build process:

./build-mobile-apps.sh android
When prompted, type 'y' to proceed with building the Android App Bundle (AAB).

Step 8: Find the AAB File
After the build completes successfully, you will find the AAB file at:

android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
