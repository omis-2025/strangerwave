## Notes on Scaling Costs

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the minimum viable infrastructure and scale as needed
2. **Serverless Options**: Consider serverless deployments for lower initial costs
3. **Reserved Instances**: For stable workloads, use reserved instances to reduce costs
4. **CDN Usage**: Leverage CDNs to reduce bandwidth costs and improve performance
5. **Free Tiers**: Utilize free tiers of services when starting out

### When to Upgrade

| Metric | Threshold for Upgrade | Component to Upgrade |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Server CPU > 70% | Consistent for 24+ hours | Increase server capacity |
| Database connections > 80% | During peak hours | Upgrade database tier |
| WebRTC connection failures > 10% | During peak usage | Add/upgrade TURN server |
| API response time > 500ms | Average over 24 hours | Optimize code or upgrade server |
| Concurrent users > 100 | Consistent daily peak | Add load balancing |

## Revenue Considerations

To put costs in perspective, here are estimated revenue projections based on the monetization strategy:

| Scale | Users | Premium Conversion | Estimated Monthly Revenue |
|-------|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Small | 5K DAU | 3% (150 premium users) | $450 + unban fees + tokens |
| Medium | 15K DAU | 4% (600 premium users) | $1,800 + unban fees + tokens |
| Large | 30K DAU | 5% (1,500 premium users) | $4,500 + unban fees + tokens |

Based on these projections, the application should be profitable at all scale levels with proper management.

## Payment Processing Fees

Remember to account for payment processing fees in your revenue calculations:

- **Stripe**: 2.9% + $0.30 per successful charge
- **PayPal**: 2.9% + $0.30 per successful charge
- **International Transactions**: Additional 1% for international payments

## Additional Considerations

- **Bandwidth Costs**: Video chat features can consume significant bandwidth
- **Seasonal Fluctuations**: User traffic may vary seasonally
- **Geographic Distribution**: Costs may vary based on user location
- **Feature Expansion**: Adding new features may increase infrastructure requirements
- **Mobile App Store Fees**: 15-30% of in-app purchases if using native mobile apps
