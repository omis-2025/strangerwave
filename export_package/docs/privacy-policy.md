# StrangerWave Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: April 17, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to StrangerWave. We've designed this platform with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our services.
