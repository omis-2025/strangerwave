# Engagement Rewards System

The StrangerWave Engagement Rewards System is designed to encourage continued user interaction with the platform and promote desired behaviors. This document outlines how the daily rewards, points system, and trust levels work together to create a compelling engagement loop.

## Daily Login Rewards

The daily login rewards system provides escalating benefits for consistent platform usage.

### Implementation

- **Escalating Value**: Rewards increase based on login streak length
- **Streak Protection**: Premium users receive streak protection to prevent breaks

### Reward Structure

|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Day 1-3       | 5 tokens     | +3 tokens    |
| Day 4-7       | 10 tokens    | +5 tokens    |
| Day 8-14      | 15 tokens    | +8 tokens    |
| Day 15-30     | 25 tokens    | +15 tokens   |
| Day 31+       | 40 tokens    | +25 tokens   |

### Special Milestone Bonuses

Trust levels represent a user's standing in the community based on their engagement and behavior.

### Trust Level Tiers

## Technical Architecture
