## Testing Process

1. **Local Testing**:
   - Run on simulator/emulator
   - Test core functionality
   - Fix immediate issues

2. **Alpha Testing**:
   - Deploy to internal team
   - Collect feedback on major functionality
   - Iterate on critical issues

3. **Beta Testing**:
   - Deploy to TestFlight/Play Store internal testing
   - Expand tester pool
   - Focus on edge cases and stability

4. **Pre-Release Testing**:
   - Final compliance checks
   - Performance optimizations
   - Security audit
   - Analytics verification

## Test Reporting

Report issues using the following format:

```

## Testing Notes

- Always test payments in sandbox/test mode
- Verify that moderation systems work correctly
- Test with slow network conditions to ensure graceful degradation
- Verify GDPR/Privacy compliance in all user flows
